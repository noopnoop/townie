{-# LANGUAGE MultiParamTypeClasses #-}

This module contains the 'Game' type and the 'play' function, which must be understood together.

We see that 'Game s r' is simply a type synonym for 'State s (Maybe r)'. 
However, the 'Maybe' here plays an important role, opposite of how the 'Maybe' monad typically acts.

'play' takes a value of type 's', the initial state, 
a function of type 'a -> Game s r', which we may think of as a function that handles inputs, 
and an object of type 't a' where t is traversable.
We may think of 't a' as a bunch of inputs. 

'play' works much like foldM, working down the traversable with this input-handling function and spitting out a final 'Game s r' value.
The key thing to note is that the instant we get a non-'Nothing' value in our traversal, we are done- the game has reached its conclusion.
On the contrary, if 'foldGame' never encounters a non-'Nothing' value in its traversal, that indicates a game that is not yet finished.
